                    *************PROBLEM STATEMENT*************

45)   
          Fuzzy logic assisted COVID 19 safety assessment of dental care. In this problem i have to create 
          a application/ GUI with the use of tkinter . this application should take inputs from user and 
          after chacking all the conditions  it should book a appoinntment , if any of conditions are false 
          then it should not book an appointment for user/patient. In this problem fuzzy logic should take 
          decision by itself after analysing all the conditions.
