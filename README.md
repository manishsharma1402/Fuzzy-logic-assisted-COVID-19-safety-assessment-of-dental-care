# Fuzzy-logic-assisted-COVID-19-safety-assessment-of-dental-care
I've created Fuzzy logic assisted COVID 19 safety assessment of dental care with tkinter .

this project will help dental hospitals to allot appointment on daily basis .
there are two type of services which can opted accordingly 
1) Emergency Services:
emergency services opted when patient met with any accident or something emergency happen to him/her .
in this case this app will ask about body temperature od patient and accordingly shift him/her in isolated
or non-isolated ward.

2) Regular Services :
 This services opted when a patient comes for routine checkup. 
 in this case app will ask about body temerature of patient , any recent travel history and do he/she lives in containment
 zone ?
 if all the conditions satisfied then their appointment will be booked .
 if any of the condition do not satisfied then it will not book any appointment 
 and it will just close the app.
 
 If our appointment is booked successfully then it will show a popup message of booking confirmaion .
